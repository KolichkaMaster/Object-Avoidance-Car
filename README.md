# Object-Avoidance-Car

This repository contains the open-source code for a car, equipped with an ultrasonic sensor, which automatically and autonomously steers itself clear of any obstacles in front of it. The sensor, alongside the car's 4 motors, are connected to an Arduino Nano, on which the code is housed. All of them work simultaneously and perform a series of steps: upon approaching an object, the car makes a series of measurements to determine the optimal direction in which to turn, and then continues on its journey. For more information about the logic behind the car, check out the scheme and the flowchart included in the repository. The final product can be seen on the image provided (the protective bumper is optional).
