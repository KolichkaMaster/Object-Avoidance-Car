# Object-Avoidance-Car

This repository contains the open-source code for a car, equipped with an ultrasonic sensor, which automatically and autonomously steers itself clear of any obstacles in front of it. The car has 4 motors, and upon approaching an object, it performs a series of measurements to determine the optimal direction in which to turn, and then continues on its journey. For more information about the logic behind the car, check out the scheme and the flowchart included in the repository.
